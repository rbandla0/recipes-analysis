# Introduction

This dataset contains the recipes, recipes's information, and average ratings. Using this dataset, the one question I want to answer is: \
***What is the relationship between the cooking time and the average rating of recipes?***\
Through this analysis, I have find out if there is a connection between longer food preparation time and the average rating of that food. The dataset has 83,782 rows, and the columns that are relevant to my question are 'minutes' and 'avg_rating'.
